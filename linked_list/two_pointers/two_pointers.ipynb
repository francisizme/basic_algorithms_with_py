    "# Two Pointers Moving in Parallel\n",
    "Consider the following problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a method that returns the nth last element of a singly linked list.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example: given a linked list with the following elements 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5, return the 2nd to last element. The answer would be element 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to do this, you’ll need some way of knowing how far you are from the end of the list itself. However, in a singly linked list, there’s no easy way to iterate back through the list when you find the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want, you can try your hand at the problem directly, or we can walk through some approaches below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approaches\n",
    "One thing that might first come to mind is to use a list to store a representation of the linked list, and then to obtain the nth to last element from this list. While this approach results in an easy-to-read implementation, it could also use up lots of memory maintaining a dual representation of the same data. If the linked list has one million nodes, we’ll need one million pointers in a list to keep track of it! An approach like this results in an extra O(n) space being allocated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code for this approach would look like the following:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def list_nth_last(linked_list, n):\n",
    "    linked_list_as_list = []\n",
    "    current_node = linked_list.head_node\n",
    "    while current_node:\n",
    "        linked_list_as_list.append(current_node)\n",
    "        current_node = current_node.get_next_node()\n",
    "    return linked_list_as_list[len(linked_list_as_list) - n]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Instead of creating an entire parallel list, we can solve this problem by using two pointers at different positions in the list but moving at the same rate. As in the previous example, we will use one pointer to iterate through the entire list, but we’ll also move a second pointer delayed n steps behind the first one. A count variable can keep track of the position of the current element in the linked list that the tail pointer is pointing to, which is initially set to 1 which is the first element’s position.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pseudocode for this approach would look like the following:\n",
    "```\n",
    "nth last pointer = None\n",
    "tail pointer = linked list head\n",
    "count = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "while tail pointer exists\n",
    "  move tail pointer forward\n",
    "  increment count\n",
    "\n",
    "  if count >= n + 1\n",
    "    if nth last pointer is None\n",
    "      set nth last pointer to head\n",
    "    else\n",
    "      move nth last pointer forward\n",
    "\n",
    "return nth last pointer\n",
    "```\n",
    "When the tail pointer moves n nodes into the linked list from its starting position of 1, it will be at position n + 1. We want the nth last pointer to be n nodes behind, so we set the nth last pointer to the head node at position 1. This is because the position n nodes behind the n + 1th node is (n + 1) - (n) = 1. Then, each following iteration will move both pointers at the same speed, until the tail pointer points to the end of the linked list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s visualize the steps of the algorithm through the following example, where we want to obtain the 2nd to last node of the linked list. T represents the tail pointer and N represents the nth last pointer. For each iteration of the while loop, we will also keep track of the count value.\n",

    "# Pointers at Different Speeds\n",
    "Using two pointers moving in parallel was a good solution to the previous problem. However, there are other problems where having two pointers moving in parallel wouldn’t be as useful. Let’s take a look at one of those problems and consider a new strategy that uses two pointers moving at different speeds.\n",
